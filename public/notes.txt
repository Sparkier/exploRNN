IMPROTANT:
    - adjust the key bindings with the correlating buttons and disable them accordingly


TODO:
    - Rearrange data creation to support one by one prediction of
        values
    - Change the rest of the code to work with this new data creation 
    - Leave the rest be for now


Data - Plan:
    - Train the model more intuitively by creating a large dataset
        and let the network train over multiple epochs/batches
    - Test the network with one prediction cycle after one epoch
        -> take ONE sample data block (first?) and let the network predict a
            whole interval of values step by step, while using the predicted
            values also as new input value 
        -> discuss the length of input and prediction intervals


Quick thoughts:
    - for the net description panel make an overview with all steps and
    highlight the current step while training, so the user can easily follow
    the training process without being overwhelmed by too much text

    - maybe make the visual components more "fl√§chiger", more modern to 
    adjust the look and feel 

    - maybe add an animated background, with small, soft animations for 
    a nicer look of the window itself

    - maybe consider adjusting widths and heights when the window is resized
