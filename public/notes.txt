TODO:
    - Rearrange data creation to support one by one prediction of
        values
    - Change the rest of the code to work with this new data creation 
    - Leave the rest be for now


Data - Plan:
    - Train the model more intuitively by creating a large dataset
        and let the network train over multiple epochs/batches
    - Test the network with one prediction cycle after one epoch
        -> take ONE sample data block (first?) and let the network predict a
            whole interval of values step by step, while using the predicted
            values also as new input value 
        -> discuss the length of input and prediction intervals
